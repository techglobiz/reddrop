#About us
We’ve been working from2022

RedDrop  is India’s largest youth-led organization dedicated to achieving blood sufficiency across the nation. We collaborate with colleges, corporates, and residential welfare associations (RWAs) to support blood banks in meeting demand. Our approach offers a comprehensive 360° solution—spanning awareness, donation, and emergency support. From inspiring individuals to become regular donors, organizing donation camps, to operating a 24/7 helpline for urgent blood requests—we ensure that no life is lost due to the lack of blood.
